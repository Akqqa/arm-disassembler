# Class for storing instruction info - based on each instructions' xml file
# Due to nature of instructions, should have one class for the xml, then contains many objects that are classes iclass

# Superclass will contain:
# aliases
# list of class objects
# PERHAPS store the explanations section here too

# Subclasses will contain:
# the regdiagram as an instruction encodding?
# the different asmtemplates based on the ecndogins
# pseudocode

# When an instructon is matched:
# superclass goes through each class, matches the instructionencodings
# once correct iclass found, can get an object of the correct symbols
# use pseudocode to map symbols
# superclass can map these to the symbols, then the asmtemplate used!
